## Purpose

This is a library project to collect or create examples of Kubernetes provisioning.

Provisioning a Kubernetes cluster is not easy for beginners, and testing or POCing Kubernetes features is even harder.

So I created this project because I thought that sharing own know-how or automated scripts, even if they're not as well organized as possible, could give your work some momentum.

If you have any simple automated script for provisioning kubernetes clusters, please share yours!!
